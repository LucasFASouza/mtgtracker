## Technology Stack

The MTGTracker application leverages the power of Django for its backend, a high-level Python web framework known for its efficiency and scalability in developing robust web applications. With Django, we can seamlessly integrate a RESTful API and ensure secure user authentication.

On the frontend, MTGTracker utilizes React Native, a JavaScript framework that allows for the development of native mobile applications with a single codebase. React Native enables a smooth and responsive user experience, with features like React Navigation for intuitive app navigation.

This technology stack not only streamlines the development process but also ensures a high level of performance, making MTGTracker an ideal tool for competitive Magic: The Gathering players seeking to enhance their gameplay through comprehensive match tracking and insightful analytics.
