Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_postgresql_connection_string
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
AUTH_SECRET=random_secure_string_for_session_encryption
```

Each variable is used for:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string to your Neon PostgreSQL database
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Your Google OAuth Client ID (from Google Cloud Console)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Google OAuth Client Secret
- `AUTH_SECRET`: A random string used for encrypting auth sessions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mtgtracker.git
   cd mtgtracker
   ```
2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
3. Run the development server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
4. Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action

## üìä Database Setup

1. Create a Neon PostgreSQL database at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
2. Copy your connection string to the DATABASE_URL environment variable
3. Push the schema to your database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   # or
   pnpm db:push
   # or
   yarn db:push
   ```

## üå± Seeding Sample Data

To generate sample match data for testing:

1. First, create an account in the app (Google sign-in)
2. Find your user ID from the database:

   - Run `npm run db:studio` to open Drizzle Studio
   - Navigate to the "users" table
   - Copy your user ID (should be a UUID)
3. Run the seeder with your user ID:

   ```bash
   npm run db:seed-matches your-user-id-here 15
   # or
   pnpm db:seed-matches your-user-id-here 15
   # or
   yarn db:seed-matches your-user-id-here 15
   ```

   The number 15 represents how many sample matches to create (optional, defaults to 50)
